# Speculation
`WARNING: The following section is speculative, none of it is confirmed information!`

Speculation on what the changes may signify about the game's development. If changes in other files are used for speculating, they must be linked here. Speculation must remain plausible and based on objectively verifyable information. Try to write this section in a way that its text cannot be taken out of context and misunderstood by, for instance, using the conditional instead of the past.
