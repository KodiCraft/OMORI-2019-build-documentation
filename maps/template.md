# maps/Map(map\_id)
**Map name, as described in the map data itself. "Unnamed" if map has no name. "Old name/New name" if map changed names**

**File status**

File status may either be *Only in 2019 build*, *Changed from 2019 build to release* or *Only in release build*

# Description
Description of the map, description must apply to both versions of the map if applicable. If the map was drastically changed or a map at that ID became a different map entirely, create two subsections, one for each version

# Changes
Overall description of changes, leave blank if changes were minor or too distinct from eachother

## Events
### event\_01
Description of all changes in event\_01

### event\_02 - event\_05
```md
- event_02
- event_03
- event_04 (x2)
- event_05
```
If a similar or identical change was made to multiple similar events (enemies, tags, etc.), they may all be listed under a single subsection. A list of all events in the section must begin the section, if multiple events have the same name, a multiplying suffix ("(x2)", "(x3)", etc.) may be added.

## Structure
Description of changes to the level structure, this can be identified if the map loaded in-game does not align with the events.

# Speculation
`WARNING: The following section is speculative, none of it is confirmed information`

Speculation on what the changes may signify about the game's development. If changes in other files are used for speculating, they must be linked here. Speculation must remain plausible and based on objectively verifyable information. Try to write this section in a way that its text cannot be taken out of context and misunderstood by, for instance, using the conditional instead of the past.
